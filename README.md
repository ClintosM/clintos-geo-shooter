GeoShooter is a game prototype made using GameMaker Studio.

- I've temporarily paused development for this prototype.
- It's based on an old game I had developed using GameMaker years ago: https://clintos.itch.io/te-entropy.
- This project is very barebones and was just a quick test to see how I felt using GameMaker studio after a couple of years of inactivity with it. Since using it last, I feel like my internal paradigm for programming no longer aligns with the way GameMaker studio handles scripting. (OOP, Interfaces, Composition and more have become staples to my internal paradigm when it comes to programming, so returning to GameMaker's scripting system feels quite combersome and difficult to approach).
- Feel free to clone this repo and have fun with it.
